ShineGet.me
-----------

Shine Get is a universal wish list to keep track of all your shopping desires
 and let you know when you should buy them.

Each item you have in your wish list will be monitored for price changes so you can
 come back and see which of your desired items are currently on sale or at a lower price

There are lots of features to add but please check out the site and request any new
 features that aren't already in the issue list :)

Development
-----------

Getting up and running should be as simple as:

    bundle install
    rake db:migrate
    rails server

More docs to come such as...

* Ruby version
* System dependencies
* Configuration
* How to run the test suite
* Services (job queues, caches, etc.)
* ...

Deploying
---------

Current http://shineget.me is managed by myself but any pull requests will be uploaded
as soon as they are approved.
